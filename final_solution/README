Program Description:

	This program was designing a shaded toroidal spiral. The program is split into three
seperate sources. The first draws just the spline of the spiral. The second draws the
wireframe mesh of the spiral. The third is the final toroidal spiral which is fully shaded.

How to Build:

Building -

	Once the file is uncompressed simply run the command make in terminal.

Running - 

	After having run make there are three seperate programs below is the command to run each
and a small description of each.

	./toroid_spline (this displays the spline curve)
	./toroid_mesh		(this displays the wireframe mesh)
	./toroid_shaded	(this displays the fully shaded toroidal spiral)

List of Files:

Makefile - The file to build the program from included source files.

toroid_spline.c - The source file the implements the toroidal spiral spline curve in opengl using glut

toroid_mesh.c - The source file the implements the toroidal spiral wireframe mesh in opengl using glut

toroid_shaded.c - The source file the implements the toroidal spiral fully shaded in opengl using glut

matrix.c - Source file includes all required matrix operations.

matrix.h - Header file for matrix.c

README - The README for the program (this file).
